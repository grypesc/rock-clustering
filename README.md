# rock-clustering

Python implementation of ROCK clustering algorithm from original paper and my own adaptation of it to geographical data. You can find 
examples of its usage in test_uci_mushrooms.py, test_uci_congressional_voting.py, test_rock_geographical.py. These scripts
require data files to run, provide them, in a original form, in a data directory.
